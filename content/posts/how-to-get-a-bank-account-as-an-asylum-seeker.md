Before you get your refugee status, and when youâ€™re an asylum seeker, you are likely to find it difficult to open a current account. You can try one of the following options:

\- Option 1: Traditional bank account

\- Option 2: Traditional bank basic account

\- Option 3: Non-traditional banks - These usually have fees, so are more expensive, but the advantage is that they are very easy to open for anyone. Examples: [Pockit](http://www.pockit.com) or [Monese.](http://monese.com)

To open a bank account with METRO, you need to visit [in person](https://www.metrobankonline.co.uk/store-locator/).
