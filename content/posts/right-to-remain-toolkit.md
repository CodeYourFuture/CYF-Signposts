Use this guide to find out what you and your supporters can do to help strengthen your legal case. Look out for the **ACTION SECTION** boxes throughout the guide!

T﻿his toolkit also explains the difference between legal advice, which **no one at CYF may give by law**, and legal support, which we can help with. (Mainly writing letters of support.)
