## How to join the library

1. Find a library near you by googling it with your postcode, for example "public library M1 6NG"
2. Go to the library. Sometimes you need a letter showing your address, so bring one if you can.
3. Go to the desk and ask to join the library. You can join any library - you don't need to live locally.
4. Once you have your card and PIN, ask to use the computers.
5. It is always completely free to join and use the public library, but there might be time limits on the free internet.

### Tips

1. If you need more than one hour internet time, ask at the desk for the time you need before you start. It's usually fine unless they are very busy.
2. If the library is a "Library of Sanctuary", you won't need any ID or proof of address.
3. You need to bring your own headphones to the library. If you don't have any, CYF has free headphones you can get from class.
4. You've got to be quiet in the library, but you are really welcome to use it. Everybody wants you to use the library!
