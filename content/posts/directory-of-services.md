Tï»¿his directory of services is published each year. This directory is intended for refugees, asylum seekers, migrant communities, health and social care practitioners and agencies working with them to identify services that offer advice and support to assist refugees and asylum seekers and migrants to settle and rebuild their lives in the UK. Charity organisations and services alter regularly; some may close or reduce the services they provide, or new ones set up.
