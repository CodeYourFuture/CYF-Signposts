Iï»¿t can be hard to find weekend childminders who are Ofsted-registered, but CYF can only reimburse Ofsted registered providers. This website sorts providers by postcode and shows a calendar of availability, so you can see who is open at the weekend and call them.

You can also make your own profile explaining your requirements and providers may apply to you.
