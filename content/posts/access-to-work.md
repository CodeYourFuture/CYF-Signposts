Access to Work can help you get or stay in work if you have a physical or mental health condition or disability.

The support you get will depend on your needs. Through Access to Work, you can apply for:

* a grant to help pay for practical support with your work
* support with managing your mental health at work
* money to pay for communication support at job interviews

You are not eligible for Access to Work support as a trainee at Code Your Future. However, you can apply for Access to Work up to 6 weeks before you start work if you have a job offer.
