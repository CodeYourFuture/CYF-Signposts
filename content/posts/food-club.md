#### Food Club

If you’re having to make impossible choices between paying a bill or putting a meal on the table, or simply struggling to make ends meet, Mustard Tree’s Food Club could help.

Join Mustard Tree as a client and for just £3.00 you can purchase up to 10 items, including vegetables, fridge items, meat and fish.

To join Mustard Tree you just need to pop into any of our shops with proof of benefits or low income, ask another organisation to refer you, or give us a call on 0161 850 2282 to book an appointment to come in and see one of the team. You can also email us on [referrals@mustardtree.org.uk](mailto:referrals@mustardtree.org.uk).
