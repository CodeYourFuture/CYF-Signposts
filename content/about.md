Code Your Future is a community filled with expertise, but this expertise is largely in programming. We are a vocational training programme, not a support service. We cannot provide legal advice, immigration advice, therapy, social services, or healthcare. It would be irresponsible for us to try to deliver these services as untrained amateurs. We are tech professionals, not lawyers, psychiatrists, or social workers.

Many people in our community are dealing with serious, long-term, and complex problems. Signposting to specialist services is the responsible thing to do. Do not try to handle these serious problems yourself.

Knowing the limits of your expertise, or working within your competence, is an ethical boundary everyone must maintain, for the health and safety of our community.

For example, it is a criminal offence, punishable by fine and/or imprisonment, for anyone to provide, or offer to provide, immigration advice and services without being approved to do so. If you did not know that, what else do you not know?

We cannot fix everything and we must not try. What we can do is create many opportunities and remove simple material barriers. The most important thing to understand is that at Code Your Future we can create many chances. If anyone has a major blocker, that is preventing them from succeeding, it really is ok to withdraw, deal with the situation, and come back when ready to work.

We will be here when they (or you!) are ready.
