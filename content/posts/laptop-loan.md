Cï»¿odeYourFuture can loan you a laptop if you do not have one to use for our course. This is available for any trainee. You will enrol as a trainee at the end of the first module of Introduction to Programming

This is a loan only; you should return the laptop when you get a job in tech after completing the course. If you leave the course, you need to return the laptop to CYF.

The laptop is free of charge.

After you have completed the form, you will get an email with a loan agreement to sign. Once signed, a CYF member in your region will be in touch with the next steps.
