We support refugee professionals with at least 2 years’ overseas experience in roles related to architecture, business services, IT, telecoms, project management and civil, electrical and mechanical engineering.

- Build your profile – we help you create a detailed skills portfolio, a UK standard CV and to network.
- Match your skills to roles – we can’t make promises of jobs but we will guide you in how to spot the right roles.
