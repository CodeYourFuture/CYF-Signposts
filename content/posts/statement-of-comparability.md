The purpose of the Statement of Comparability service is to allow people with qualifications completed outside of the UK to evidence the comparable level of these in the [UK education frameworks](https://www.enic.org.uk/Documents/Guide%20to%20the%20UK%20education%20systems_final.pdf).

The Statement of Comparability helps to explain and to give context to your qualifications when you are applying for a job or for study.\
\
You do **not** need to pay for this document to apply for CYF. Do not do this. This signpost is for CYF grads applying for **jobs** with required qualifications. \
\
If you are a refugee who has *lost* their documents, email us about this. There is a specialist refugee team at ENIC to help with this situation.
